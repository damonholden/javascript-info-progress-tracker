# Recursion and Stack Notes

- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- Recursion is useful when tasks can be naturally split into simpler tasks or similar variants.
- Recursive code is normally a fair bit shorter than its iterative counter-part.
- Typically a recursive stack can be reliable to about 10_000 in most javascript engines.
