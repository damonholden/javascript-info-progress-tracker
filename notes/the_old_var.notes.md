# the old var

The information here is for understanding old scripts. New code should not be written like this.

There are 3 ways to declare a variable:

- `let`
- `const`
- `var`

`var` is similar to `let`. Most of the time, `var` declarations can be replaced with `let` ones and things should work the same.

internally, `var` behaves very differently to `let` and `const`.

## `var` has no block scope
