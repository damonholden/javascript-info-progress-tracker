const ourPlanetName = 'Earth';
// Note, we could use a shorter name planet, but it might not be obvious what
// planet it refers to. It’s nice to be more verbose. At least until the
// variable isNotTooLong.

const currentUserName = 'Jane';
// Again, we could shorten that to userName if we know for sure that the user is
// current.

// Modern editors and autocomplete make long variable names easy to write. Don’t
// save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.
